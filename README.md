Anico Docs Vol 1.

Purpose: The purpose of this website is to hone skills in Web Dev and to showcase what a interactive animation companies website can do.

Features: In this first Beta stage I would like to introduce 3 features which should compliment the the interactions between consumer and company
    1. Newsletter/Updates- A general Sign-up sheet for new users to see what they might be getting into on the newsletter should have a registration form which then goes into a interest selection and even a suggestion box.
    2. Video Upload/conferencing- Setting up a page which shows the different product this company has on deck (allows for future updates) followers can upload vids in the same vein to show an inspiration link with previous videos. Comments and a rating system to further the bonds between site and consumer. Conference call can be used by certain members for special access
    3. General discussion-Open forum page to discuss ideas, existing pieces of work, and anythin gin relation.
